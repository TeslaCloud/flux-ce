Flux is a WIP gamemode framework designed with performance and convenience in mind.

# Alpha release
Current version of Flux is currently in active development as an open alpha. This means that you can install it and it will run, but there will almost inevitably be bugs and issues, as well as a lot of missing features. If you are not a developer, it is probably better for you to wait until Flux is in beta.

# Installation
Standard. Just match the repo folders with the folders on your server and you're done. To run it just start your server with +gamemode set to a schema name ("reborn" schema is included with this repo)

# Playing
If you wish to play the gamemode, you should install the content addon to prevent purple-black checkers where the materials should be. You can find it here: <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1518849094>
